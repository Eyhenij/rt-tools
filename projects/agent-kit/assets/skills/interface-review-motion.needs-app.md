# Animations

Interruptible animations and enter/exit transitions. Contextual icon animations, scale on press and
skipping animation on page load are in `interface-review-motion-states`.

## When to use

- A finding of `interface-review` is about an animation that cannot be interrupted, a jarring
  entrance or a dramatic exit.

## Interruptible Animations

Users change intent mid-interaction. If animations aren't interruptible, the interface feels broken.

### CSS Transitions vs. Keyframes

| | CSS Transitions | CSS Keyframe Animations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Behavior** | Interpolate toward latest state | Run on a fixed timeline |
| **Interruptible** | Yes, retargets mid-animation | No, restarts from beginning |
| **Use for** | Interactive state changes (hover, toggle, open/close) | Staged sequences that run once (enter animations, loading) |
| **Duration** | Fixed; retargets the value mid-flight, not the timeline | Fixed timeline, restarts from the beginning |

```css
/* Good: interruptible transition for a toggle */
.drawer {
  transform: translateX(-100%);
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.drawer.open {
  transform: translateX(0);
}

/* Clicking again mid-animation smoothly reverses, no jank */
```

```css
/* Bad: keyframe animation for interactive element */
.drawer.open {
  animation: slideIn 200ms ease-out forwards;
}

/* Closing mid-animation snaps or restarts, feels broken */
```

**Rule:** Always prefer CSS transitions for interactive elements. Reserve keyframes for one-shot
sequences.

## Enter Animations: Split and Stagger

Use this pattern for infrequent staged entrances where sequence helps communicate hierarchy, such as
the first load of a page hero, success state, or empty state. Break a large container into semantic
chunks and animate each individually. Stagger only where the entrance is infrequent; anything the
user triggers often should animate as one container, or not at all.

### Step by Step

1. **Split** into logical groups (title, description, buttons)
2. **Stagger** with ~100ms delay between groups
3. **For titles**, consider splitting into individual words with ~80ms stagger
4. **Combine** `opacity`, `blur`, and `translateY` for the enter effect

### Code Example

```tsx
// Motion (Framer Motion): staggered enter
function PageHeader() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
      variants={{
        visible: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } },
      }}
    >
      <motion.h1
        variants={{
          hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 12, filter: "blur(4px)" },
          visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, filter: "blur(0px)" },
        }}
      >
        Welcome
      </motion.h1>

      <motion.p
        variants={{
          hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 12, filter: "blur(4px)" },
          visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, filter: "blur(0px)" },
        }}
      >
        A description of the page.
      </motion.p>

      <motion.div
        variants={{
          hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 12, filter: "blur(4px)" },
          visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, filter: "blur(0px)" },
        }}
      >
        <Button>Get started</Button>
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### CSS-Only Stagger

```css
.stagger-item {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(12px);
  filter: blur(4px);
  animation: fadeInUp 400ms ease-out forwards;
}

.stagger-item:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0ms; }
.stagger-item:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 100ms; }
.stagger-item:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 200ms; }

@keyframes fadeInUp {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
    filter: blur(0);
  }
}
```

## Exit Animations

Exit animations should be softer and less attention-grabbing than enter animations. The user's focus
is moving to the next thing; don't fight for attention.

### Subtle Exit (Recommended)

```tsx
// Small fixed translateY: indicates direction without drama
<motion.div
  exit={{
    opacity: 0,
    y: -12,
    filter: "blur(4px)",
    transition: { duration: 0.15, ease: "easeOut" },
  }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

### Full Exit (When Context Matters)

```tsx
// Slide fully out: use when spatial context is important
// (e.g., a card returning to a list, a drawer closing)
<motion.div
  exit={{
    opacity: 0,
    x: "-100%",
    transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: "easeOut" },
  }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

### Good vs. Bad

```css
/* Good: subtle exit */
.item-exit {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-12px);
  transition: opacity 150ms ease-out, transform 150ms ease-out;
}

/* Bad: dramatic exit that steals focus */
.item-exit {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(-100%) scale(0.5);
  transition: all 400ms ease-out;
}

/* Sometimes correct: remove immediately when motion adds no context */
.item-exit {
  display: none;
}
```

**Key points:**
- Use a small fixed `translateY` (e.g., `-12px`) instead of the full container height
- Keep some directional movement to indicate where the element went
- Exit duration should be shorter than enter duration (150ms vs 300ms)
- Use a subtle exit when it preserves spatial context. Remove immediately when motion adds no
  information, the interaction repeats frequently, or reduced motion is requested.

## Scope

Everything in this section assumes the animation belongs. Whether it belongs at all — what it costs
the user at its trigger frequency, and whether it should be shortened, made one-sided, or deleted —
is a separate question, and the answer defaults to no.

Honoring `prefers-reduced-motion` is covered by the accessibility principles in
`interface-review-principles`; apply it to every animation in this section.
